Labs &amp; projects from Artificial Intelligence course (2017-2018 school year)

# Contents

8 puzzle:

* A project that solves a [sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) problem with BFS
* 8puzzle-efficient optimizes matrix indexing for better efficiency

15 puzzle: 

* A modified version of the 8-puzzle problem that uses 15 sliding tiles instead of 8
* Implementation and comparision of BFS, bidirectional BFS, iterative-deepening DFS, and a greedy algorithm
* Greedy uses Manhattan distance as a heuristic

Railroad:

* A solution to the shortest path problem using A*

8 queens:

* A solution to the [n queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) problem using [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)
* Includes graphs of the algorithm's speed from n=5 tp n=200 created with Matplotlib


Sudoku:

* A 9x9 sudoku solver using a similar approach as n queens

Tic Tac Toe:

* A project that will play tic-tac-toe with a user and never lose
* Uses the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with [alpha beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)

Decision Tree:

* An intro into machine learning that generates a decision tree from a csv file
* Calculates [Shannon Entropy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Shannon_entropy) to determine the tree structure
* The Jupyter Notebooks folder contains some more machine learning code including stochastic hill climbing, back propagation, and forward propagation

nltk:

* Some natural language processing excersises using the python library [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
